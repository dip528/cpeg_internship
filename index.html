            The Child Psychiatric Epidemiology Group (CPEG) is directed by Christina W. Hoven, DrPH, MPH. It is a multidisciplinary (including epidemiology, psychology, medical geography, psychiatry, etc.) research group, focused on understanding the development of psychiatric disorders and substance use by studying children as they mature.

            Research is conducted both nationally and internationally, with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIDA, NIMH, NICHD, etc.), CDC, the European Union, and more. The objectives of our investigations are to produce population-based knowledge that is generalizable, and inclusive of underserved and high-need groups, especially those of high public health relevance.

           CPEG is a multidisciplinary (including epidemiology, psychology, medical geography, psychiatry, etc.) research group, which utilizes a wide range of methods (e.g. field-based interviews, genetics, and fMRI) to understand child psychopathology and substance use. CPEG's research is both national (local) and international, with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIDA, NIMH, NICHD, etc.), CDC, the European Union, and more. All of the activities of CPEG are designed to answer important questions and to help fill knowledge gaps concerning children's mental health. A primary focus is the transmission of trauma from parent to child.
           The CPEG internship program provides opportunities to be involved with multiple aspects of our ongoing field research projects, including recruitment, interviews (data collection), maintenance of research data and administrative support. The internship position also provides an opportunity to become involved in other CPEG research projects, with the potential to assist on scholarly work.
           Internships are currently open on three longitudinal studies. Two of these seek to better understand the experiences, feelings, and role of stress on parents and children in an effort to determine the mechanism(s) by which traumatic experiences of a parent may be passed on to their child. The third study focuses on the long term effects of direct exposure to a traumatic event (9/11) during childhood.

            Dr. Hoven's career has focused on improving children's mental health services. She was Principal Investigator of the 2002 study: "Effects of The World Trade Center Attacks on New York City Public School Students," conducted on a representative sample of 8,236 students. That first epidemiological study of children following a major disaster included an assessment of eight psychiatric disorders. Important insights generated concern the relationship of psychopathology to various types of exposure, including previous exposure to trauma, and the importance of assessing children far from the immediate locus of disaster for psychological impact. That study is credited with immediately bringing more than $33 million federal dollars for child mental health services to NYC, as well as significantly raising awareness about post-disaster child mental health problems in general. In an effort to further explain some of that study's findings, Dr. Hoven is currently in the process of assessing children of World Trade Center evacuees and is preparing to do a study of the children of First Responders in New York City and in Israel. She is also actively engaged in a multi-national study focused on identifying appropriate methodologies for raising awareness of child mental health issues. Dr. Hoven is currently the Director of the International Center for Child and Adolescent Mental Health in the National Center for Disaster Preparedness.

            The Stress & Well-Being Study (“S&W”) is a new study, with data collection just beginning, and aims to improve understanding of the effects of children’s direct exposure to the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center on mental health disorders, substance use or abuse and other risky behaviors, as these individuals enter into adolescence and emerging adulthood. This study assesses children directly exposed to 9/11 at ages 0-12 (currently ages 12-24), who will be compared to unexposed controls. These interviews are conducted in English, Spanish, and Mandarin.
            The Stress and Justice Studies (“S&J”) are two longitudinal research projects that aim to understand the ways that children are affected by stressful events, particularly parental contact with the criminal justice system. These studies seek to understand mechanisms of familial transmission of stress, trauma and substance abuse. The samples are primarily composed of families from the South Bronx. The index samples include families with at least one parent (one study focuses on mothers and the other on fathers) who had recent contact with the criminal justice system. There are also controls composed of families who have not had this experience. These interviews are conducted in English and Spanish.
            **Position Requirements**
            We welcome individuals who are motivated, punctual, professional, and able to work independently and in a team-oriented environment.
            We prefer current graduate students or those with advanced degrees in psychology, public health, neuroscience, biostatistics, law, medicine, social science, or related fields. We will also consider accomplished undergraduate students. Our internship program is very competitive and attracts talented undergraduate and graduate students from across the country and around the world.

              A primary focus of our research is the transmission of trauma from parent to child. Current, ongoing, research seeks to answer questions regarding children who were exposed to disaster (both directly and indirectly) or other difficult life circumstances, such as having a parent involved with the criminal justice system. Present studies are being conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Cantonese.

              CPEG is also actively involved internationally, most recently in Israel, Taiwan, Zimbabwe, Tajikistan, Jordan, and Brazil, in addition to 11 European countries, including 4 in Eastern Europe. The foci of these often large-scale epidemiological investigations vary, but always have the psychological well-being of children as the primary agenda, and include randomized control trials, examination of factors related to suicide and deliberate self-harm, child mental health awareness, and childhood trauma resulting from war.

              Across Europe, much effort has been made over recent decades to ensure high-quality longer-term care for people with severe mental disorders, which helped to advance mental health care in many countries. These include improvements in the living conditions in psychiatric hospitals, the development of community services, the integration of mental health care within primary care, the development of psychosocial, the protection of the human rights of people with mental disorders and the increasing participation of users and families in the improvement of policies and services.

              However, much more has still to be done. The reality is that in many countries, people with these disorders continue to reside in large psychiatric hospitals or social care institutions with poor living conditions, inadequate clinical assistance and frequent human rights violations. In some countries, although progress has been made in the transition from psychiatric hospitals to community care, the resources allocated to the new services are very limited and responses to psychosocial needs are very scarce. The ultimate goal of the Work Package 5 is to develop recommendations for action at EU-level and in Member States that may lead to a more effective implementation of the desired shifting to community-based mental health systems and services.
